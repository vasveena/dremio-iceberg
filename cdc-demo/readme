1) Create an RDS Aurora MySQL Database 
2) Turn on binary logging - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/enable-binary-logging-aurora/ 
3) Login to mysql instance, create schema and table, insert some values 
4) Go to DMS console and do the following
	a. Create source for the RDS Aurora MySQL DB
	b. Create target as an S3 bucket/prefix in your account 
	c. Create a replication instance with same network configs as your database
 	d. Create DMS migration task (full load, ongoing replication) with source, target and replication instance created above. Choose the schema and table name from step 3
 	e. Start the task and wait until it succeeds
    f. Check if the files are deposited in S3 target
5) Create a table in Athena on top of this S3 DMS target as well as an empty Iceberg table
6) Get the Glue connector from AWS Marketplace - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iicxofvpqvsio
	a. Accept terms to subscribe
	b. Configure the connector. Choose Glue 3.0 as the fulfillment option and 0.12.0-2 as Software version
	c. Go to Usage -> Activate the Glue connector from AWS Glue Studio
	d. Provide a name for your connector and select "Create connection and activate connector"
7) Create a Glue ETL job 
	a. Select Glue 3.0 and Python3
	b. Under connections, choose Iceberg Connector for Glue 3.0
	c. Under job parameters, provide your Iceberg warehouse location 
	eg: key = --iceberg_job_catalog_warehouse and value = s3://vasveena-test-iceberg/warehouse
8) Run the Glue job. Once the job completes successfully, query Athena Iceberg table
9) Now go back to mysql instance and make some changes to the table. Replication in DMS is ongoing so it will take a few mins to deposit new files on S3 target
10) After that, re-run the Glue ETL. Once the ETL is done, query the Athena Iceberg table again to see the changes
