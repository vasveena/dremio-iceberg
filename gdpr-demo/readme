1) Create Kinesis Data Generator account - https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-kinesis-data-generator/web/help.html
2) Create Kinesis data stream 
3) Create an S3 bucket and prefix called "custdata"
4) In Kinesis Data Generator, choose the region and Kinesis stream. Provide the template for test data generation
5) Get the Glue connector from AWS Marketplace - https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iicxofvpqvsio
	a. Accept terms to subscribe
	b. Configure the connector. Choose Glue 3.0 as the fulfillment option and 0.12.0-2 as Software version
	c. Go to Usage -> Activate the Glue connector from AWS Glue Studio
6) Create an Athena table on top of the S3 bucket / prefix from Step 2
7) Create a Spark streaming Glue ETL job with the script from Github repo. This ETL takes following parameters -

--iceberg_job_catalog_warehouse	s3://bucket/custdata/
--output_path	s3://bucket
--kinesis_arn	arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:<AWS Account ID>:stream/demo-data-stream
--user-jars-first	True

Also, under the connector provide the Iceberg Glue MARKETPLACE connector
8) Run Glue job. It will be in Running state since it is Spark streaming
9) Run UPSERTs and DELETEs from Athena
10) Run vacuum on the table to remove unnecessary snapshots and metadata files
